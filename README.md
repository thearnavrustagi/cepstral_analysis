# cepstral_analysis

This was just a small script to calculate cepstral of a small window of audio to improve audio analysis, several of these windows create the MFCC, which is one of the strongest feature extraction techniques for audio data, letting us reconstruct entire audios by giving us the fundamental pitch of the data thus helping us analyse the audio better
